## 📈 Coverage Analysis

### Current Coverage Status
Based on the latest coverage analysis:

```
Lines Coverage:     0.61%  (199/32,356)
Statements:         0.59%  (201/33,998)
Functions:          0.42%  (38/8,917)
Branches:           0.79%  (84/10,601)
```

### Coverage Analysis Context
The low coverage percentages reflect that many tests are present but not executing due to:
1. **Test Infrastructure Issues** - Recently resolved
2. **Integration Test Limitations** - Require external services
3. **E2E Test Setup** - Not included in unit coverage metrics
4. **Mock Configuration** - Some tests skip actual execution
