## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Redundancy**: Eliminated duplicate workflow specifications
2. **Improved Consistency**: Unified terminology and examples across all documentation
3. **Enhanced Usability**: Clear, educational platform-specific examples
4. **Better Organization**: Logical document structure with clear relationships
5. **Current Information**: All documentation updated to reflect 2025-08-26 state
6. **Educational Focus**: Specialized content for educational workflow scenarios

## Next Steps

1. Review consolidated documentation for completeness
2. Test API examples with actual jaqEdu platform integration
3. Update any external references to removed files
4. Consider creating quick-start tutorial based on consolidated information
5. Set up documentation versioning for future updates

## Summary

The workflow documentation consolidation successfully created a comprehensive, non-redundant documentation set that accurately reflects the jaqEdu educational platform's workflow system capabilities while maintaining all essential technical and implementation information.
