- Comprehensive security reporting

**Key Jobs:**
- `dependency-security`: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- `dependency-review`: PR dependency security review
- `code-security`: Advanced code security analysis
- `secret-scanning`: Secret detection and validation
- `security-headers`: Security configuration validation
- `security-report`: Comprehensive security reporting

### 6. Release Automation (`release.yml`)

**Triggers:** Version tags, manual dispatch

**Features:**
- Automated version bumping
- Release notes generation
- Security validation before release
- Production deployment
- GitHub release creation with assets
- Rollback capabilities

**Key Jobs:**
- `prepare-release`: Version preparation and validation
- `build-release`: Release asset creation
- `security-check`: Pre-release security validation
- `deploy-production`: Production deployment
- `create-release`: GitHub release creation

### 7. CodeQL Analysis (`codeql.yml`)

**Triggers:** Push, PR, weekly schedule

**Features:**
- Advanced static analysis
- Security-focused code scanning
- SARIF result uploads
- Custom query configurations
- Comprehensive vulnerability detection
